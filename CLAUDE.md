# Block Game

An original voxel survival game in Rust on Bevy 0.20. Starting area: the Great Swamp.
The full research and phase plan lives in the Claude Doc "Block Game: Research and Build Plan".
This is not a Minecraft clone: original names, art, creatures and systems only.

## Layout

| Path | What | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `crates/voxel` | Coordinates, chunks, blocks, tile sheet | No Bevy, no rendering. Shared with a future server. |
| `crates/worldgen` | Terrain, biomes, caves, sky islands | Pure functions of (seed, position); thread-safe; no Bevy. |
| `crates/game` | The Bevy client; one plugin per system | Gameplay state separate from rendering, so multiplayer can come later. |
| `assets/textures/blocks.png` | 16x16 grid of 32x32 tiles | Placeholder art; Ethan repaints it. Keep tile positions stable. |
| `assets/textures/blocks.ron` | Tile name -> index | Regenerate with `python3 tools/gen_placeholder_art.py` (overwrites the PNG). |

## Commands

- `cargo run --features dev` - play, fast rebuilds (dynamic linking).
- `cargo run --release` - check real performance.
- `cargo run --release --features trace` - profile with Tracy.
- `cargo check`, `cargo clippy --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace` - before every hand-off.

## Conventions

- Bevy is pinned to one version; upgrade only between phases. Bevy 0.20 renamed things
  (`shadow_maps_enabled`, `FontSize::Px`, `CursorOptions` as its own component) and shaders are
  WESL (`import bevy_pbr::render::...`, `@group(constants::MATERIAL_BIND_GROUP)`); check compiler
  hints and the 0.20.1 example shaders on GitHub before assuming older API.
- Content (blocks, items, foods, biomes, skill nodes) goes in RON data files, not code.
- Chunks are 32^3 (`voxel::CHUNK_SIZE`). Chunks stack vertically; no world height limit.
- Heavy work (generation, lighting, meshing) runs on `AsyncComputeTaskPool`, never the main thread.
- Pixel art is sampled nearest-neighbour (`ImagePlugin::default_nearest()`).
- Target: 60 fps at 16-chunk view distance on Ethan's MacBook (Apple Silicon, Metal).

## Status

- Phase 1 (foundation): done.
- Phase 2 (voxel core): done. Data-driven blocks (`assets/data/blocks.ron`), palette chunks,
  binary greedy mesher (`voxel::mesher`), texture-array terrain shader (`assets/shaders/voxel.wesl`),
  threaded generation/meshing in `game::world`, break/place in `game::interact`, test terrain in `worldgen`.
- Known gaps: edits are lost when a chunk unloads (saving is phase 3); water is not see-through yet
  (phase 4); vertices are 40 bytes, not the packed 8-byte format (performance pass).
- Next: phase 3, world generation.

## Testing without a screen

`BLOCKGAME_SCREENSHOT=shot.png cargo run` waits for chunk loading to settle, saves a screenshot and quits.
In the cloud container: `BEVY_ASSET_ROOT=$PWD BLOCKGAME_SCREENSHOT=/tmp/s.png WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1280x720x24" ./target/debug/block-game`
(needs `mesa-vulkan-drivers xvfb libxkbcommon-x11-0`).
